# JS App Wireframe

_Started [2017-08-14]_

JS App development environment wireframe.

Based on
[JS Stack From Scratch tutorial](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch)
by [verekia@github](https://github.com/verekia).

If any particular version recommended there are certain grounds
as of this project starting date.

## Workflow

`Code` => `Lint` => `Import packages`
=> `Transpile` => `Test` => `Build` => `Publish`

Coding is that what you want to do. Other stages should and
can be automated as much as only possible. There are essential
inevitable tools like `git` and `node`, while publishing methods
may significantly vary depending on the product delivery platform.

The tools are explained and commented in sections below.

This particular project is documented while following
instructions from
[JS Stack From Scratch tutorial](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch).
Tools and practices that are specific to React+Redux toolchain
are marked as "optional". Should you use different framework,
please, consider studying relevant toolchain.

My recommendation to the beginners:

make a project following
[JS Stack From Scratch tutorial](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch)
and use this document as a quick reference.

### Inevitable Tools

VCS (`git`), JS runtime (`NodeJS`), and 
package management tool (`yarn`) are globally
installed essential tools to develop applications
in JS Stack.

#### git

Learn [git](https://git-scm.com/). It is simple yet powerful
tool.

> üí° Under Windows make sure to choose setup options
`Use Git from from the Windows Command Prompt` and
`Checkout Windows-style, commit Uniex-style line endings`
for the sake of compatibility.

In this document `git` will also be referred to as the **VCS**
(version control system).

TODO: SSH vs HTTPS.

[üîù back to contents](#contents)

#### node & npm

[Node](https://nodejs.org/) is a JS runtime most of the tools
employ. Install
[node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

Stick to any LTS version <7.0, as the latter may cause some
cross-tool and cross-platform compatibility issues.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager that
supports code sharing, reuse, and update. Gets installed along
with NodeJS, but you will want to use [yarn](#yarn) instead.

[üîù back to contents](#contents)

#### yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager.

Install for: [Windows](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-tab) |
[MacOS|Unix](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#alternatives-tab)
(recommended approach to
[avoid relying on other package managers](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1505)).

> üí° You may need restarting Windows in order to changes to system environment take effect.

[üîù back to contents](#contents)

### Project Initialization

Let's consider you start the project from the scratch. Should you want
to work with some existing project consider changing tools-related files
instead of creating and initializing those.

Create a project folder and `cd` into it.

> üí° In the end, when you fetch your repo to different
machine `yarn install` will do all project development
environment bootstrapping job automatically.

#### git

In console/terminal run `git init` OR use IDE functionality to put
the project under VCS.

Add `.gitignore` file to your project or edit existing.
Your project doesn't need any temporary or IDE-specific
auxiliary files and folders pushed to repo. Check well commented
`.gitignore` from this project.

Check also
[a collection of `.gitignore` templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

#### yarn

In console/terminal run `yarn init` and answer questions. `package.json` will be created.

> üí° Entry point is a script, which initializes your app and glues
everything together.

Add `package.json` to VCS.

Add packages with:
 * those you need your app to function with - `yarn add [package]`
 * those required to build the app or during dev - `yarn add --dev [package]`

> üí° Use `yarn remove [package]` to get rid of unrequired package.

### Transpiling and Linting

Install some extra tools for your project
 * to benefit from improved ES6 syntax
 * to benefit from consistent code style
 * to benefit from _strict typing_ (optional)

#### ES6 code transpilation

Currently JS runtimes require code in ES5. Feel free coding in ES6
and/or use 3rd party source code, which might also be ES6 specific
by employing [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

Run `yarn add --dev babel-cli` to install Babel CLI.

Run `yarn add --dev babel-preset-env` to install Babel preset package
with configurations for the most recent ECMAScript features support.

Add `.babelrc` for Babel configuration. Refer to the one in this project
for details.

[üîù back to contents](#contents)

#### Linting tool

[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) produces recommendations about ES6 code
formatting, which enforces style consistency in your code.

Install recommended config package following
[instructions from Airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)
using `yarn` instead of `npm`.

> üí° You may need
[install-peerdeps](https://github.com/nathanhleung/install-peerdeps) under Windows.

As of _project-start-date_ under Windows you run:
`yarn global add install-peerdeps`
`install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb`

Add `.eslintrc.json` for ESLint configuration. Refer to the one in
this project for details.

Run `yarn add --dev eslint`

Update `package.json` with a new task:
```javascript
"scripts": {
  "start": "babel-node src",
  "test": "eslint src"
},
```

Run `yarn test` to see if Linting passes OK. Fix any styling errors.

##### JS API compatibility checks

Run `yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-compat` to install browser compatibility
checking tool.

Add `"browserlist": ["> 1%"],` to `package.json` to check against browsers
that have more than 1% market share.

Add `"plugins": ["compat"],` to `.eslint.json`.

##### Linting with IDE

Do not use IDE native ES6 linting. To enjoy your custom linting config
try set up IDE so it uses the binary from your `node_modules` instead.

[üîù back to contents](#contents)

#### Type checking [optional]

JS employs _loose typing_ and _dynamic typing_.
Use [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) to check types and code
following strict typing.

This will require type annotations in code, which makes code non-standard,
and you need to teach other tools not to raise errors when parsing the
code.

Run `yarn add --dev flow-bin babel-preset-flow babel-eslint eslint-plugin-flowtype`
to make Babel and linting Flow compatible.

Add `"flow"` to `"presets"` array in `.babelrc`.

Update `.eslintrc.json`:
```javascript
{
  "extends": [
    "airbnb",
    "plugin:flowtype/recommended"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "flowtype",
    "compat"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "semi": [2, "never"],
    "no-unexpected-multiline": 2,
    "compat/compat": 2
  }
}
```

Chain flow to your test task in `package.json`: `"test": "eslint src && flow"`.

Add `.flowconfig` file (refer to the one in this project).

Add Flow annotations to source files - mark the file to be type-checked and
add functions parameters typing.

##### Type checking with IDE

Consider configuring IDE so you have immediate feedback
when Flow detects issues in the code.

##### Errors you won't fix

It may happen that Flow detects errors that may not want to fix. E.g.
those coming from 3rd party code from `node_modules`.

Remove Flow-related settings from `.babelrc`, `.eslintrc.json` and `package.json`.
In this project Flow is disabled. Check `*-flow*` files for Flow settings.
Please, note that `*-flow*` files do not contain any changes
that follow this section.

### Testing

Automate code testing tasks and get prevented from
publishing bad code that doesn't pass tests.

#### Automated tests [optional]

Run `yarn add --dev jest babel-jest` to install
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

Add `"env": { "jest": true }` at the object root in `.eslintrc.json`.

Chain `jest --coverage` to `"test"` script in `package.json`.

Add `/coverage/` to `.gitignore`. This folder will contain data
on codebase covered with tests.

Create `*.test.js` for each `.js` you want to get tested.

Run `yarn test` to see the results.
Open `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html` with your browser
to see the report.

[üîù back to contents](#contents)

#### Publish healthy code only [optional]

Run `yarn add --dev husky` to install
[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky),
a tool to add
[Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)
that prevent committing and pushing code until it passes tests.

Add following `precommit` and `prepush` scripts to `package.json`:
```javascript
"scripts": {
  "start": "babel-node src",
  "test": "eslint src && flow && jest --coverage",
  "precommit": "yarn test",
  "prepush": "yarn test"
},
```

It will try run `test` task upon committing and pushing
the code via VCS.

##### Issues resolution

1. Tests do not run upon commit or push.

It may happen that Husky didn't install properly.
Try `yarn add --dev husky --force`.

It may also happen your IDE doesn't run Git hooks. Check IDE
settings.

2. You didn't change any code and running tests is senseless.

Use `git push --no-verify`.

3. Don't want tests upon committing or pushing.

Remove `precommit` and `prepush` tasks from `package.json`.

### Building Web App

Setup web-server (`Express`), let app get updated
without restarting the server (`Nodemon`),
and build production-ready app (`PM2`).

Employ module bundler (`Webpack`),
benefit from JSX (`React`), 
and enable Hot Module Replacement (`HMR Webpack`).

While JSX support is optional, in this example HMR
is specifically tuned to support React. Consider
changinr HMR options as appropriate when you do not 
want to support JSX.

Create folders:
 * `public/` - to place `*.css` and other static files for direct access at front-end
 * `src/client/` - front-end code
 * `src/server/` - back-end code
 * `src/shared/` - shared between front- and back-end (e.g. _routes_)

Create `src/shared/config.js` for server config.

Create `src/shared/util.js` for Node settings re web-server status.

Create `src/server/index.js` as an entry point that will
bootstrap the web-server and set it up.

Create `src/server/render-app.js` that will build a front-end
part of the app.

In `package.json` change your start script like so: 
`"start": "babel-node src/server",`

#### Web-server

Run `yarn add express compression` to install
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

Run `yarn start` and browse to `http://localhost:8000`.

You can stop web-server with **Ctrl-C**. Launch web-server
from dedicated terminal window.

#### Monitoring the changes

Run `yarn add --dev nodemon` to install
[Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to get code
used by web-server updated.

Change the `scripts` in `package.json`:
```javascript
"start": "yarn dev:start",
"dev:start": "nodemon --ignore lib --exec babel-node src/server",
```

Run `yarn start`, browse to `http://localhost:8000`, make
some changes in code output and reload the page to
see changes take effect.

[üîù back to contents](#contents)

#### Production-ready app code

Run `yarn add --dev pm2` to install
[PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to have ES6=>ES5
transpiled code for production (will be placed in `lib/`).

Run `yarn add --dev rimraf` to automate `lib/` clean-up.

Run `yarn add --dev cross-env` to enable environment
variable passing to a tool (`PM2`) in UNIX-style 
under Windows.

Add `"prod:build": "rimraf lib && babel src -d lib --ignore .test.js",`
to `scripts` in ` package.json`.

Add `/lib/` to your `.gitignore`.

To launch build at production stage 
add to `script` in `package.json`:
```javascript
"prod:start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production pm2 start lib/server && pm2 logs",
"prod:stop": "pm2 delete server",
```

Now **Ctrl-C** will terminate not web-browser but `prod:start`
script. Run `yarn prod:stop` to stop the web-server.

Modify `prepush` hook: `"prepush": "yarn test && yarn prod:build"`
so build is checked before pushing to remote repo.

The workflow:
* `yarn prod:build`
* `yarn prod:start`
* **Ctrl-C** to terminate previous
* `yarn prod:stop` to stop the web-server
